# Mapping_Earthquakes

This analysis used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data fron an URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

In addition, the interactive graph below shows the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth.

Then a dark layer was created to reflect this information
